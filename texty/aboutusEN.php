<h3> History </h3>
<p> The Institute of Automobile Mechatronics was established on July 1, 2013 as a pedagogical and scientific research unit of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the STU in Bratislava. The establishment of the Institute of Automobile Mechatronics was a logical consequence of the intention of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the STU in Bratislava to create an institute that would take into account the current requirements and needs of the automotive industry in Slovakia with the main aim of preparing bachelor and engineering graduates for automotive mechatronics.
        At present, the Institute of Automobile Mechatronics provides research, development and education in several areas of applied mechatronics with special emphasis in automotive mechatronics and mechatronic systems based on the integration and synergy of mechanical, electronic, information, communication and management technologies into complex mechatronic car systems. </p>

<p> The Institute guarantees study programs at all levels of study accredited at STU in Bratislava. For the wide-area teaching and research area, it integrates researchers and educators from the FEI STU into the research and teaching process in the individual study programs. </P>

<P> The Department of Pedagogy provides in the bachelor's degree program the teaching of subjects with a major emphasis on mechanics and mechatronic elements. At the engineering level, ŠP ensures the teaching of subjects with emphasis on simulation and modeling of mechanical and mechatronic systems, both in terms of mechanics and dynamics, as well as from the point of view of multiphysical interconnection of individual physical domains. </P>

<P> The members of the department are concerned with the formulation of new mathematical procedures and methods used in multiphysical analyzes, (FGM), dynamic analyzes of mechatronic and MEMS systems as well as a description of piezoelectric elements. </P>

<P> The members of the department use modern SW tools such as ANSYS, Catia and MSC.ADAMS to design, analyze and optimize individual components as well as entire subsystems of mechatronic elements. </P>
