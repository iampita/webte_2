<h3> What is Mechatronics </h3>
<P> Mechatronics is an engineering department that stands at the interface of several areas of research, development and applications. It combines elements of mechanics, electronics, automation and computing. A typical mechatronic system receives signals from an external environment using various types of sensors, which it processes and transforms to perform the necessary force, movement or other type of action intervention. It allows the mechanical system to be expanded by sensors and microcomputers. The mechatronic system is controlled by software that is an integral part of the product and essential to its proper functioning. </P>
